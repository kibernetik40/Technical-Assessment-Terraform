To install Istio Service Mesh on Minikube using Terraform and Helm, we can use the following script. 
1. Installation of necessary components
We check that the following components are installed:
-Minikube
-Helm
 -Terraform
2. Setting up Terraform
Create a directory for our project and create a file in it main.tf
3. Initialization and application
-Let's go to the directory with the file main.tf .
-Initialize Terraform:
    - ├── terraform init
-Apply the configuration:
    - ├── terraform apply
4. Access to the application
After successfully applying the configuration, we will be able to access the application through the Istio Ingress Gateway. To do this, we will first get the Minikube IP address:
- ├── minikube ip
Then open the browser and go to http://<minikube_ip>/, replacing <minikube_ip> with the received IP.
Notes
-We are making sure that all dependencies (Minikube, Helm, Terraform) are installed and configured.
-The Istio version in the example can be changed to the current one at the time of use.
-Depending on the settings of our Minikube, we may need to use additional parameters to work with kubectl and other tools.
Now we should have a working Istio Service Mesh with an example Apache HTTPD-based application!
